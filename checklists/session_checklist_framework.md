## Checklist Delivery and Tracking

### Delivery Method
- Checklists will be provided at the beginning of each work session
- Format will be clear, concise, and actionable
- Will be delivered as a standalone message for easy reference

### Tracking Mechanism
- User will mark tasks as completed
- AI will track completion status
- Incomplete tasks will be carried forward to next session if necessary
- Completion history will be maintained for reference

### Adaptation Process
- Checklists will be adapted based on project progress
- Time estimates will be refined based on actual completion times
- Task complexity will be adjusted based on user feedback
- Format will be optimized based on user preferences

## Integration with Master Implementation Plan

The session checklists will be directly derived from the Master Implementation Plan, focusing on the specific phase and stage of implementation. Each checklist will:

1. Extract relevant tasks from the current position in the Master Plan
2. Translate AI-Human collaboration points into specific actionable items
3. Prioritize tasks based on dependencies and critical path
4. Provide appropriate context from previous sessions
5. Set expectations for upcoming work

This ensures the checklists remain aligned with the overall implementation strategy while providing clear, actionable guidance for each specific work session.
