# Pre-Authorized Accounts and Payment Methods Framework

This framework establishes a secure system for managing financial accounts and payment methods with defined limits to enable autonomous operation while maintaining appropriate security and oversight.

## 1. Account Authorization Structure

### 1.1 Account Tiers and Access Levels

| Account Tier | Purpose | Autonomous Access Level | Human Verification Requirements |
|--------------|---------|-------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Tier 1: Operations | Day-to-day transactions, service payments, platform fees | Full access within spending limits | Quarterly review of transaction logs |
| Tier 2: Investment | Platform-specific investment accounts, trading accounts | Limited access with pre-approved parameters | Monthly review and approval of investment plans |
| Tier 3: Reserve | Emergency funds, contingency reserves | Monitoring access only | All access requires human authorization |

### 1.2 Platform-Specific Authorization

| Platform Type | Authorization Method | Autonomous Capabilities | Renewal Requirements |
|---------------|----------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| Freelance Marketplaces | [AUTH_METHOD] | Can create listings, message clients, deliver work | [TIME_PERIOD] token refresh with human verification |
| Payment Processors | [AUTH_METHOD] | Can receive payments, issue refunds up to limit | [TIME_PERIOD] credential rotation |
| Digital Product Platforms | [AUTH_METHOD] | Can create/update listings, process orders | [TIME_PERIOD] session renewal |
| Content Platforms | [AUTH_METHOD] | Can publish/update content, moderate comments | [TIME_PERIOD] token refresh |
| Cloud Services | [AUTH_METHOD] | Can deploy pre-approved resources | [TIME_PERIOD] key rotation |

### 1.3 Authentication Management

1. **Credential Vault System**
   - Encrypted storage of all access credentials
   - Compartmentalized access based on operation type
   - Automatic credential rotation schedule
   - Tamper detection and notification

2. **Session Management**
   - Automated session refreshing within security parameters
   - Session activity logging and anomaly detection
   - Graceful session expiration handling
   - Backup authentication methods

3. **Multi-Factor Authentication Handling**

   - Notification system for new MFA challenges
   - Escalation protocol for authentication failures

## 2. Payment Method Framework

### 2.1 Payment Method Hierarchy

| Payment Type | Autonomous Transaction Limit | Approval Requirements | Usage Restrictions |
|--------------|------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Virtual Card - Operational | Up to [AMOUNT_LIMIT] per transaction, [AMOUNT_LIMIT] daily | Transactions >[AMOUNT_LIMIT] require approval | Platform fees, subscription services, digital advertising |
| Virtual Card - Marketing | Up to [AMOUNT_LIMIT] per transaction, [AMOUNT_LIMIT] daily | Transactions >[AMOUNT_LIMIT] require approval | Advertising platforms, promotion services |
| Payment Processor Account | Up to [AMOUNT_LIMIT] per transaction, [AMOUNT_LIMIT] daily | Transactions >[AMOUNT_LIMIT] require approval | Product/service payments, marketplace fees |
| Cryptocurrency Wallet | Up to [AMOUNT_LIMIT] equivalent per transaction | All transactions require notification | Specified platforms with crypto payment options |
| Primary Bank Account | Monitoring access only | All transactions require explicit approval | Emergency use only |

### 2.2 Spending Limit Controls

1. **Progressive Limit System**
   - Initial limits set conservatively
   - Automatic limit increases based on successful transaction history
   - Performance-based limit adjustments (increased limits for high-ROI activities)
   - Temporary limit expansion for time-sensitive opportunities with notification

2. **Category-Based Restrictions**
   - Pre-approved merchant categories
   - Platform-specific spending allowances
   - Purpose-coded transaction tagging
   - Prohibited category blocks

3. **Temporal Controls**
   - Time-of-day restrictions for certain transaction types
   - Cooling-off periods between large transactions
   - Scheduled payment windows for regular expenses
   - Temporary freeze capability for suspicious activity

### 2.3 Transaction Verification Workflow

```
TRANSACTION VERIFICATION PROCESS
|
+-- Transaction Initiation
|   |
|   +-- If Amount <= Autonomous Limit AND Category = Pre-approved
|   |   |
|   |   +-- Process transaction immediately
|   |   |
|   |   +-- Log transaction details
|   |   |
|   |   +-- Update available balance
|   |
|   +-- If Amount > Autonomous Limit OR Category â‰  Pre-approved
|       |
|       +-- Generate approval request
|       |
|       +-- If Time-sensitive (needed within [TIME_PERIOD])
|       |   |
|       |   +-- Send high-priority notification
|       |   |
|       |   +-- If no response within [TIME_PERIOD] AND Amount <= [PERCENTAGE]x Limit
|       |   |   |
|       |   |   +-- Process transaction with special logging
|       |   |
|       |   +-- If no response within [TIME_PERIOD] AND Amount > [PERCENTAGE]x Limit
|       |       |
|       |       +-- Hold transaction and escalate notification
|       |
|       +-- If Not time-sensitive
|           |
|           +-- Queue for standard approval
|           |
|           +-- Hold until explicit approval received
|
+-- Post-Transaction Processing
    |
    +-- Record transaction details in secure ledger
    |
    +-- Update spending pattern analytics
    |
    +-- Adjust available limits for remaining period
    |
    +-- Generate transaction receipt and confirmation
```
