# Project Brief: Nick the Great - Autonomous Income Generation

## Core Mission

To empower AI-human collaboration (Nick the Great + Human Collaborator) to systematically build and scale efficient digital businesses, starting from zero capital and aiming for unlimited, sustainable passive income growth.

## Primary Method

Leveraging AI (Nick) for research, analysis, content creation, operational task execution, and optimization, while the Human Collaborator handles strategic decisions, account management, financial transactions (when applicable), and approvals.

## Current Project Focus (Phase 0)

- **Experiment 1:** Develop and monetize "The Indoor Eden Co." website (located in `website/`) via affiliate marketing.
- **Goal:** Establish the first income stream using zero-capital methods by enhancing the existing website asset.

## Key Success Metrics (Overall Project)

- **Financial:** Month-over-month growth in passive income generated from experiments.
- **Autonomy:** Percentage of operational tasks handled autonomously by Nick.
- **Efficiency:** Ratio of income generated to human time invested.
- **Scalability:** Potential for successful experiments to grow significantly.
- **Framework:** Creation of a replicable process for AI-human business building.

## Initial Scope (Phase 0 - Website Experiment)

- Enhance the existing "The Indoor Eden Co." website (`website/`).
- Implement affiliate monetization (Amazon Associates, potentially others).
- Track performance (traffic, conversions, income).
- Document processes and learnings in the Memory Bank.

## Key Questions (Ongoing)

- Which business models offer the highest ROI for AI-human collaboration with zero/low capital?
- How can Nick's autonomy be maximized for specific tasks?
- What are the most effective strategies for scaling successful experiments?
- How can human oversight time be minimized while maintaining strategic control?
