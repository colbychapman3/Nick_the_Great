# Progress: Nick the Great - Phase 0 Progression

## Current Status (Phase 0 - Website Experiment)

-   **Framework Established:** The "Nick the Great" AI-human collaboration framework, mission, and core goals are defined and documented in `README.md` and all core Memory Bank files.
-   **Phase 0 Focus:** Confirmed that the initial focus is enhancing and monetizing the existing "The Indoor Eden Co." website (`website/`) as the primary zero-capital experiment.
-   **Website Enhancement (Subtask 1.1):**
    -   **COMPLETED:** Logo implementation - Selected the dark green logo concept, saved as `logo.png`, and updated references across all HTML files.
    -   **COMPLETED:** Image assets - Successfully sourced and added all 12 previously missing images to `img/` directory and verified they display correctly.
    -   **COMPLETED:** Placeholder Pages - Created basic placeholder files (`plant-guides.html`, `shop-recommendations.html`, `privacy-policy.html`) to resolve broken links.
    -   **IN PROGRESS:** Content review and optimization.
-   **Live Website Discovery:**
    -   **COMPLETED:** Discovered and confirmed the site is already published at https://theindooreden.wordpress.com/ (4/12/2025).
    -   **COMPLETED:** Created a WordPress UI replica (`wordpress-replica.html` and `css/wordpress-style.css`) for reference and visual understanding.
-   **Website Analysis:**
    -   **COMPLETED:** Successfully tested browser tools MCP server on the live WordPress site.
    -   **COMPLETED:** Conducted accessibility audit (score: 93/100) and SEO audit (score: 82/100).
    -   **IDENTIFIED:** Specific improvement opportunities from audit results.
-   **Memory Bank Architecture:** All six core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) now fully reflect the "Nick the Great" framework and current project status.

## What Works

-   Memory Bank system effectively maintains context across sessions, supporting the Nick the Great autonomous operation model.
-   Using `replace_in_file` accurately across multiple files to implement consistent changes (replacing text logo with image logo, updating Memory Bank files).
-   Browser testing to verify implementation changes and image display.
-   Multi-step tracking of project status and next actions via `activeContext.md` and `progress.md`.
-   Detecting and addressing file naming issues (double extensions in image files).
-   Collaborative problem-solving with Human Collaborator, focusing on high-value decisions while Nick handles operational details.
-   Browser tools MCP server for conducting accessibility and SEO audits on the published site (though screenshot functionality remains non-operational).
-   Creating visual reference implementations (WordPress UI replica) to better understand and document the published site's design.
-   Using audit results to identify specific improvement opportunities (color contrast for accessibility, meta descriptions for SEO).

## What's Left to Build/Define (Immediate Focus - Phase 0 Website)

-   **Website Enhancement (Subtask 1.1 Remaining):**
    -   Complete content review for quality, SEO optimization, and conversion potential.
    -   Identify and recommend any content gaps or opportunities for expansion.
    -   Verify all internal and external links are functional.
    -   Address issues identified in accessibility and SEO audits:
        -   Fix color contrast on the "Subscribe" button
        -   Add proper meta descriptions
        -   Improve descriptive link text
    
-   **Monetization Setup (Subtask 1.2):**
    -   Amazon Associates account setup (Human Collaborator Task).
    -   Implement proper affiliate tracking IDs to replace placeholder Amazon search URLs.
    -   Review and potentially expand affiliate program participation beyond Amazon.
    -   Determine how to integrate affiliate monetization with the live WordPress site.
    
-   **Performance Tracking (Subtask 1.3):**
    -   Implement analytics solution (likely Google Analytics - requires Human Collaborator action).
    -   Configure the `affiliate-income-tracker` MCP server for monitoring once earnings begin.
    -   Develop content performance tracking metrics and reporting.
    -   Establish a regular audit schedule using browser tools MCP server for the live site.
    
-   **Site Strategy Decision:**
    -   Decide on approach given dual implementation (static HTML files and live WordPress site).
    -   Determine whether to maintain both implementations or focus efforts on one.
    -   Plan coordination strategy if maintaining both implementations.
    -   Develop optimization strategy based on audit results.

## Known Issues

-   Affiliate links currently use placeholder URLs (general Amazon search results) and need updating with actual tracking IDs once the Associates account is active.
-   The website lacks actual product images for affiliate products, which may impact conversion rates.
-   No analytics implementation yet, making performance tracking impossible.
-   Accessibility issue: Insufficient color contrast (4.02) on the "Subscribe" button text on the WordPress site.
-   SEO issues: Missing meta description and non-descriptive link text on the WordPress site.
-   Screenshot functionality in browser tools MCP remains non-operational despite connector running on port 3025.

## Evolution of Decisions

-   **Project Pivot:** Shifted from general AI autonomy enhancement ("Cline") to a specific goal-oriented AI-human collaboration framework ("Nick the Great") focused on passive income generation.
-   **Initial Strategy:** Moved from abstract framework building to concrete application via enhancing the existing "The Indoor Eden Co." website as the first Phase 0 experiment.
-   **Capital Requirement:** Adjusted from an initial $50 investment to a zero-capital start, leveraging existing assets and capabilities.
-   **Income Goal:** Changed from a fixed $2,000/month target to aiming for unlimited, scalable growth.
-   **Implementation Approach:** Discovered dual implementation paths - static HTML files in development and a live WordPress site already published at https://theindooreden.wordpress.com/.
-   **Technical Capabilities:** Expanded our approach to include objective site quality assessment through browser tools MCP audits on the live site.
