            <h2>Our Approach</h2>
            <p>Unlike many plant websites showing perfect specimens in ideal conditions, we focus on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Real-world conditions:</strong> Plants in apartments, offices, and small spaces</li>
                <li><strong>Practical solutions:</strong> Advice that works with your lifestyle, not against it</li>
                <li><strong>Honest recommendations:</strong> Products we truly believe in, not just what's trending</li>
                <li><strong>Accessible information:</strong> Clear explanations without confusing jargon</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>About Our Recommendations</h2>
            <p>When we recommend products, we focus on value, quality, and performance - not just price. We personally research all products or rely on extensive community feedback to ensure we're only suggesting items that truly work.</p>
            <p>Some links on our site are affiliate links, which means we may earn a commission if you purchase through them. This helps support our work and allows us to continue providing free plant care information. We only recommend products we believe in and would use ourselves.</p>
