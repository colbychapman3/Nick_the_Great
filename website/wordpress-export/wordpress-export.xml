		<ul>
			<li><strong>Real-world conditions:</strong> Plants in apartments, offices, and small spaces</li>
			<li><strong>Practical solutions:</strong> Advice that works with your lifestyle, not against it</li>
			<li><strong>Honest recommendations:</strong> Products we truly believe in, not just what's trending</li>
			<li><strong>Accessible information:</strong> Clear explanations without confusing jargon</li>
		</ul>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
		<h3>Our Affiliate Relationships</h3>
		<p>This page contains affiliate links. This means if you click on a link and purchase a product, we may receive a small commission at no additional cost to you.</p>
		<p>The Indoor Eden Co. is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. We also participate in affiliate programs with other retailers and brands that align with our values and the needs of our readers.</p>
		
		<h3>How Affiliate Links Work</h3>
		<p>When you click on an affiliate link on our website, a small piece of tracking code is attached to your browser. If you then make a purchase on the destination website within a certain timeframe (typically 24 hours to 30 days, depending on the program), we earn a commission on that sale.</p>
		<p>These commissions help support the operation of The Indoor Eden Co. and allow us to continue creating free, helpful content about indoor plants and their care.</p>
		
		<h3>Our Product Recommendation Philosophy</h3>
		<p>We take our product recommendations seriously, and our affiliate relationships do not influence which products we choose to feature. We only recommend products we genuinely believe in and that we have:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Researched extensively</li>
			<li>Used personally (when possible)</li>
			<li>Received positive feedback about from multiple reliable sources</li>
			<li>Verified meet our quality standards</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The commissions we earn never influence our product reviews or recommendations. We prioritize honesty and transparency in all our content.</p>
		
		<h3>Product Reviews</h3>
		<p>When we review products, we assess them based on their performance, quality, and valueâ€”not on commission rates. We aim to provide balanced reviews that highlight both the strengths and limitations of products.</p>
		<p>If we ever receive free products for review, we will clearly disclose this in the content. However, receiving free products does not guarantee positive reviews.</p>
		
		<h3>How We Use Affiliate Income</h3>
		<p>The affiliate commissions we earn go toward:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Website hosting and maintenance costs</li>
			<li>Creating new, high-quality content</li>
			<li>Photography and visual resources</li>
			<li>Research materials and plant care supplies</li>
			<li>Compensating our team for their work</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Identifying Affiliate Links</h3>
		<p>While we may not label every individual affiliate link on our site, we include disclosure statements:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>At the beginning of posts containing affiliate links</li>
			<li>Near product recommendation sections</li>
			<li>In our website footer</li>
		</ul>
		<p>As a general rule, you can assume that most links to products on our site are affiliate links.</p>
		
		<h3>Non-Affiliate Content</h3>
		<p>Much of our content does not include affiliate links. Our plant care guides, troubleshooting articles, and educational content often contain no monetized links at all. We create this content purely to help our readers succeed with their indoor plants.</p>
		
		<h3>Contact Us</h3>
		<p>If you have any questions about our affiliate relationships or how we use affiliate links, please don't hesitate to contact us at contact@theindooreden.co.</p>

		<title>Frequently Asked Questions</title>
		<link>https://theindooreden.co/faq/</link>
		<pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
		<dc:creator>The Indoor Eden Team</dc:creator>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
		<h3>General Plant Care</h3>
		
		<h4>How often should I water my houseplants?</h4>
		<p>There's no one-size-fits-all answer, as watering needs depend on your specific plant, pot size, environmental conditions, and season. Rather than following a strict schedule, we recommend checking the soil moisture and looking for signs that your plant needs water. Most indoor plants prefer to dry out slightly between waterings. For specific guidelines, see our care guides for individual plants.</p>
		
		<h4>Why are my plant's leaves turning yellow?</h4>
		<p>Yellowing leaves can be caused by several factors, including overwatering (the most common cause), underwatering, nutrient deficiencies, light issues, temperature stress, or pest problems. Our <a href="https://theindooreden.co/blog/yellow-leaves-causes-solutions/">troubleshooting guide on yellow leaves</a> can help you diagnose and fix the specific issue.</p>
		
		<h4>Do indoor plants need fertilizer?</h4>
		<p>Yes, most houseplants benefit from occasional fertilizing during their growing season (typically spring and summer). Potted plants have limited access to nutrients once they've used what's available in their soil. However, it's better to under-fertilize than over-fertilize, as too much can damage your plants. Most houseplants do well with a balanced houseplant fertilizer diluted to half the recommended strength, applied monthly during growing season.</p>
		
		<h4>How do I know if my plant needs repotting?</h4>
		<p>Signs that your plant needs repotting include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Roots growing out of the drainage holes</li>
			<li>Roots circling around the inside of the pot (visible when you remove the plant)</li>
			<li>Water running straight through the pot without being absorbed</li>
			<li>Plant growth has slowed significantly (despite proper care)</li>
			<li>The plant becomes top-heavy and falls over easily</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Most houseplants benefit from repotting every 1-2 years, either into a slightly larger pot or simply refreshing the soil in the same pot.</p>
		
		<h3>Light Requirements</h3>
		
		<h4>What does "bright indirect light" actually mean?</h4>
		<p>Bright indirect light means your plant receives plenty of natural light but isn't exposed to direct sun rays. Good locations include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Near an east-facing window</li>
			<li>A few feet back from a south or west-facing window</li>
			<li>Next to a north-facing window (in the Northern Hemisphere)</li>
			<li>A spot where the sun's rays are diffused through a sheer curtain</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If you can see a clear, defined shadow of your hand when you hold it up in that spot, it's likely bright indirect light.</p>
		
		<h4>Can houseplants survive in rooms with no windows?</h4>
		<p>Very few plants can survive long-term without any natural light. However, many low-light tolerant plants like ZZ Plants, Snake Plants, and Pothos can survive in rooms with minimal natural light if supplemented with good quality grow lights. Our <a href="https://theindooreden.co/blog/best-grow-lights-for-apartments/">guide to grow lights for apartments</a> can help you find the right solution.</p>
		
		<h3>Plant Selection</h3>
		
		<h4>What are the best plants for beginners?</h4>
		<p>The most forgiving plants for beginners include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Snake Plant (Sansevieria)</li>
			<li>Pothos (Epipremnum aureum)</li>
			<li>ZZ Plant (Zamioculcas zamiifolia)</li>
			<li>Spider Plant (Chlorophytum comosum)</li>
			<li>Chinese Evergreen (Aglaonema)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>These plants tolerate inconsistent watering, adapt to various light conditions, and generally communicate their needs clearly. See our <a href="https://theindooreden.co/blog/best-plants-for-beginners/">complete guide to beginner-friendly plants</a> for more recommendations.</p>
		
		<h4>Which houseplants are safe for pets?</h4>
		<p>If you have cats or dogs, consider these non-toxic options:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Spider Plant (Chlorophytum comosum)</li>
			<li>Boston Fern (Nephrolepis exaltata)</li>
			<li>Calathea/Prayer Plants (Calathea spp.)</li>
			<li>Peperomia varieties (Peperomia spp.)</li>
			<li>Parlor Palm (Chamaedorea elegans)</li>
			<li>Christmas Cactus (Schlumbergera)</li>
			<li>African Violet (Saintpaulia)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Avoid toxic plants like Pothos, Peace Lily, and ZZ Plant if you have pets who might chew on them.</p>
		
		<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
		
		<h4>How do I get rid of fungus gnats?</h4>
		<p>To eliminate fungus gnats:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Let the soil dry out more between waterings (fungus gnats thrive in consistently moist soil)</li>
			<li>Use yellow sticky traps to catch adult gnats</li>
			<li>Apply a layer of sand or decorative stones on top of the soil to prevent adults from laying eggs</li>
			<li>Consider treating with BTI (Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis), a natural bacteria that kills fungus gnat larvae</li>
			<li>For severe infestations, repot plants in fresh soil</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h4>Why does my plant have brown tips on the leaves?</h4>
		<p>Brown leaf tips are often caused by:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Low humidity (especially for tropical plants)</li>
			<li>Water quality issues (fluoride, chlorine, or high mineral content)</li>
			<li>Inconsistent watering</li>
			<li>Fertilizer burn (too much fertilizer)</li>
			<li>Exposure to hot, dry air (near heaters or air conditioners)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Try increasing humidity around your plants, using filtered or distilled water, and keeping plants away from heating/cooling vents.</p>
		
		<h3>Shopping & Product Questions</h3>
		
		<h4>What should I look for when buying a new houseplant?</h4>
		<p>When shopping for plants, check for:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Overall plant vigor and health (avoid plants with yellowing leaves or signs of stress)</li>
			<li>New growth (indicates the plant is actively growing)</li>
			<li>Clean leaves free of spots, holes, or sticky residue</li>
			<li>No visible pests on the leaves or soil</li>
			<li>Roots that aren't severely circling or growing out of drainage holes</li>
			<li>A pot with drainage holes</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h4>What potting soil do you recommend for houseplants?</h4>
		<p>For most common houseplants, we recommend a high-quality indoor potting mix that's lightweight, well-draining, and enriched with some organic matter. Many plants benefit from adding extra perlite or pumice to improve drainage. Specialized plants like succulents, orchids, or African violets require their own specific soil mixes. Check our <a href="https://theindooreden.co/shop-recommendations/">recommended products page</a> for specific soil recommendations.</p>
		
		<h4>Do I need to buy special tools for plant care?</h4>
		<p>While you don't need many specialized tools to get started with houseplants, a few basic items make care easier:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Watering can with a narrow spout</li>
			<li>Spray bottle for misting (if you have humidity-loving plants)</li>
			<li>Small pruning shears or scissors</li>
			<li>Moisture meter (especially helpful for beginners)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>As your collection grows, you might want to add a humidifier, grow lights, or specialized tools for repotting.</p>
		
		<h3>Other Questions</h3>
		
		<h4>How do I find the right plants for my specific space?</h4>
		<p>We recommend assessing your space for three key factors:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Light:</strong> Observe how much natural light different areas of your home receive throughout the day</li>
			<li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Consider which rooms naturally have higher humidity (bathrooms, kitchens) vs. drier areas</li>
			<li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Note any spots with drafts, near heating/cooling vents, or temperature fluctuations</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Then match plants to these conditions rather than trying to make a plant work in an unsuitable environment. Our <a href="https://theindooreden.co/start-here/">Start Here guide</a> walks you through this process step by step.</p>
		
		<h4>Still have questions?</h4>
		<p>If your question isn't answered here, please <a href="https://theindooreden.co/contact/">contact us</a> directly and we'll be happy to help!</p>
