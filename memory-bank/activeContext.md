# Active Context: Nick the Great

## Current Focus (May 7, 2025)

We have completed Phase 3: Analysis and Synthesis. This involved consolidating findings from the project scan, identifying key components and relationships, and defining a proposed architecture for the unified agent in `design.md`. We also created `researchstack.md` detailing the core technologies.

## Recent Changes

### 1. Completed Phase 3: Analysis and Synthesis
- Created `researchstack.md` with details on core technologies (Next.js, TypeScript, Python, gRPC, MongoDB, Node.js, Express.js, AbacusAI) based on Context7 research and file analysis.
- Created `design.md` outlining the proposed unified agent architecture, component responsibilities, and integration points.
- Synthesized information from Memory Bank and `progress_log.md`.

## Current Status
- Phase 3: Analysis and Synthesis is completed.
- `researchstack.md` and `design.md` are created.
- Ready to begin Phase 4: Implementation and Testing.

## Current Decisions

1. **Adopt Proposed Architecture**: Proceed with the architecture outlined in `design.md`.
2. **Follow New Rules**: Adhere strictly to the rules provided for Phase 3 & 4 (Research Stack, Design Doc, Context7 Adherence, Consult Docs).

## Key Insights

- The project contains well-defined frameworks for autonomy, legal compliance, and technical infrastructure.
- Several directories contain valuable code and documentation for integrating various aspects of the unified agent.

## Next Steps (Phase 4)
1. **Develop Integration Plan:** Detail the steps for implementing the components outlined in `design.md`.
2. **Implement Integration Plan:** Start building/integrating the Agent Core Service, Task Execution Modules, and necessary Backend/Frontend updates.
3. **Test the Unified Agent:** Develop and execute tests for the integrated system.
