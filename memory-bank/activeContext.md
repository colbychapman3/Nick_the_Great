# Active Context: Nick the Great

## Current Focus (May 5, 2025)

We are currently implementing core features for the Nick the Great platform after successfully fixing the deployment issues between Vercel (frontend) and Render (backend).

1. **Backend API** (NodeJS/Express)
   - Successfully deployed on Render.com
   - Connected with frontend via proper CORS configuration
   - Contains user authentication endpoints and business strategy endpoints
   - Implemented with MongoDB for data storage
   - Recently added proper routes for Strategies and Resources

2. **Frontend Application** (Next.js)
   - Deployed on Vercel
   - Successfully connecting to backend
   - Authentication system fully functional
   - Recently implemented Strategies and Resources pages

## Recent Changes

### 1. Deployment & Connectivity Fixes (Completed)
- Updated service name in render.yaml from "nick-the-great-api" to "nick-the-great"
- Implemented dynamic CORS configuration on backend that handles any Vercel preview URL via regex pattern
- Fixed environment variables to use consistent service naming conventions
- Successfully deployed and tested connection between frontend and backend

### 2. Feature Implementation
- Created Strategies page with UI and API integration
- Created Resources page with UI and API integration
- Implemented proper authentication context with JWT handling
- Added placeholder content for development when no data exists

### 3. Backend API Development
- Created dedicated routes for Strategies with proper CRUD operations
- Created dedicated routes for Resources with proper CRUD operations
- Implemented proper error handling and validation
- Updated index.js to use these routes with authentication middleware

### 4. Authentication System 
- Improved the AuthContext provider with proper token handling
- Implemented JWT decoding and validation
- Added consistent authentication UI across feature pages
- Built redirects for unauthenticated users

## Current Status
- Deployment pipeline is fully functional with automatic updates
- Authentication system is properly implemented and working across environments
- Feature pages (Strategies, Resources) are implemented with proper UI
- Backend API routes are established for core features
- Mobile app structure exists but needs further development

## Current Decisions

1. **Feature Architecture**: We've implemented a consistent pattern for features:
   - Clean separation between frontend UI and backend API
   - Use of React hooks for data fetching and state management
   - Consistent UI patterns for loading, error states, and empty states
   - Development placeholders for testing UI without data

2. **Backend Organization**: We've restructured the backend to:
   - Use dedicated route files for better organization
   - Implement proper middleware patterns for authentication and database connectivity
   - Follow RESTful API principles for CRUD operations
   - Include comprehensive error handling

## Key Insights

- Dynamic CORS configuration with regex patterns is more maintainable than manually updating allowed origins
- Consistent patterns between features simplifies development and maintenance
- Placeholder content during development improves the testing experience

## Next Steps
1. Implement more comprehensive dashboard functionality
2. Add form handling for creating and editing strategies and resources
3. Implement gRPC functionality in the backend
4. Connect mobile app to existing REST APIs
5. Add more comprehensive error handling and validation
6. Implement user profile management
7. Add analytics and reporting features
