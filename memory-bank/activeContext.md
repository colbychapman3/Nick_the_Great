# Active Context: Nick the Great

## Current Focus (May 6, 2025)

We have completed Phase 2: Comprehensive Project Scan, which involved exploring the project directories and identifying relevant files and frameworks for the unified agent.

## Recent Changes

### 1. Completed Phase 2: Comprehensive Project Scan
- Explored all relevant directories within the Nick the Great project.
- Identified and reviewed key files related to autonomy, frameworks, plans, and project structure.
- Documented the usefulness of explored files and directories in `progress_log.md`.

## Current Status
- Phase 2: Comprehensive Project Scan is completed.
- We have a better understanding of the project's structure and relevant components for the unified agent.

## Current Decisions

1. **Proceed to Phase 3**: We are ready to move to Phase 3: Analysis and Synthesis to consolidate findings and define the agent architecture.

## Key Insights

- The project contains well-defined frameworks for autonomy, legal compliance, and technical infrastructure.
- Several directories contain valuable code and documentation for integrating various aspects of the unified agent.

## Next Steps
1. Proceed to Phase 3: Analysis and Synthesis.
2. Consolidate summaries of the processed files and directories.
3. Identify key components and relationships between them.
4. Define the agent architecture based on the findings.
