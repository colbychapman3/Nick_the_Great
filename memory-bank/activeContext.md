# Active Context: Nick the Great

## Current Focus (April 30, 2025)

We are currently working on fixing deployment issues with the Nick the Great platform on Vercel. The project consists of two main components:

1. **Backend API** (NodeJS/Express)
   - Deployed on Render.com
   - Currently experiencing connectivity issues
   - Contains user authentication endpoints and business strategy endpoints
   - Implemented with MongoDB for data storage

2. **Frontend Application** (Next.js)
   - Deployed on Vercel
   - Experiencing 404 issues on routes
   - Recently implemented authentication bypass system

## Recent Changes

### 1. Authentication System Implementation

We've implemented an authentication system that works both with and without the backend:

- Created an `AuthContext.tsx` that manages user state across the application
- Implemented login and registration pages with error handling
- Added development bypass option to test protected routes without backend
- Added a dashboard page with auth protection

### 2. Deployment Fixes

We've implemented several fixes for the Vercel deployment:

- Added a framework identifier in `.well-known/framework` 
- Created middleware for proper routing and API forwarding
- Implemented a catch-all 404 page for better user experience
- Fixed Next.js configuration for production deployment
- Added environment variables for API endpoints

### 3. API Connection Handling

- Created an API test page for diagnosing connection issues
- Implemented error handling for non-JSON responses
- Set up proper CORS headers for cross-origin requests

## Current Status

- Authentication system is functional with development bypass
- Frontend structure is complete
- Backend API connectivity remains an issue (404 errors on endpoints)
- The application is deployed but experiencing route issues

## Current Decisions

1. **Authentication Approach**: We've decided to implement a flexible authentication system that:
   - Attempts to use the real backend API first
   - Falls back to development mode when the API is unavailable
   - Provides simple login/logout flow with JWT tokens

2. **Deployment Configuration**: We've opted for:
   - Simplified Next.js configuration
   - Explicit framework identification for Vercel
   - Custom middleware for routing

## Key Insights

- Vercel has specific requirements for framework detection
- Static exports are not compatible with our authentication requirements
- API proxying through rewrites is the best approach for our architecture

## Next Steps

1. Test the updated configuration on Vercel
2. Verify routes are working properly
3. Debug backend connectivity if issues persist
4. Add more comprehensive error handling
5. Implement complete dashboard functionality
6. Connect the frontend to operational backend APIs for business strategies
