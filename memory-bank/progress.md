## Known Issues
1. No form implementation yet for creating/editing strategies and resources
2. Mobile app not yet connected to backend APIs

## Next Priority (Phase 4)
1. Develop Integration Plan based on `design.md`.
2. Begin implementation of Agent Core Service (Python/gRPC).
3. Refactor/Integrate first Task Execution Module (e.g., Ebook Generation).

## Learning & Insights
- Vercel has specific requirements for framework detection
- Next.js App Router requires careful configuration for authentication
- Development bypass simplifies testing without active backend
- The `autonomous_decision_matrix.md` file provides a valuable framework for defining the agent's autonomy levels and decision-making processes.
- The `autonomy_enhancement_framework.md` file provides a detailed roadmap for enhancing the agent's autonomy and capabilities.
- The `legal_compliance_framework.md` file provides a framework for ensuring that the agent operates in a legally compliant manner.
- The `notification_approval_system.md` file provides a framework for managing the agent's interactions with humans and ensuring that decisions are made in a timely and appropriate manner.
- The `preauthorized_accounts_framework.md` file provides a framework for managing the agent's financial transactions and ensuring that they are conducted in a secure and responsible manner.
- The `technical_infrastructure_framework.md` file provides a framework for managing the agent's technical infrastructure and ensuring that it is scalable, secure, and resilient.
- Unified agent architecture defined in `design.md` provides a clear path forward.
- Core technologies researched and documented in `researchstack.md`.
