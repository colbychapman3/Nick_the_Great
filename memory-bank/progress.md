## Recent Milestones
- 🏆 Successfully implemented authentication bypass system (April 30, 2025)
- 🏆 Deployed frontend to Vercel (April 29, 2025)
- 🏆 Built authentication system (April 30, 2025)
- 🏆 Created mobile app structure with React Native (May 5, 2025)
- 🏆 Fixed CORS and deployment issues (May 5, 2025)
- 🏆 Implemented Strategies and Resources features (May 5, 2025)

## Known Issues
1. No form implementation yet for creating/editing strategies and resources
2. Mobile app not yet connected to backend APIs

## Next Priority
1. Consolidate summaries of the processed files and directories.
2. Identify key components and relationships between them.
3. Define agent architecture based on the findings.

## Learning & Insights
- Vercel has specific requirements for framework detection
- Next.js App Router requires careful configuration for authentication
- Development bypass simplifies testing without active backend
- The `autonomous_decision_matrix.md` file provides a valuable framework for defining the agent's autonomy levels and decision-making processes.
- The `autonomy_enhancement_framework.md` file provides a detailed roadmap for enhancing the agent's autonomy and capabilities.
- The `legal_compliance_framework.md` file provides a framework for ensuring that the agent operates in a legally compliant manner.
- The `notification_approval_system.md` file provides a framework for managing the agent's interactions with humans and ensuring that decisions are made in a timely and appropriate manner.
- The `preauthorized_accounts_framework.md` file provides a framework for managing the agent's financial transactions and ensuring that they are conducted in a secure and responsible manner.
- The `technical_infrastructure_framework.md` file provides a framework for managing the agent's technical infrastructure and ensuring that it is scalable, secure, and resilient.
