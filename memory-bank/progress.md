## Known Issues
1. No form implementation yet for creating/editing strategies and resources
2. Mobile app not yet connected to backend APIs

## Next Priority
1. Implement form functionality for creating/editing strategies
2. Implement form functionality for creating/editing resources
3. Implement gRPC functionality
4. Connect mobile app to backend APIs
5. Implement user profile management
6. Add analytics and reporting features

## Learning & Insights
- Vercel has specific requirements for framework detection
- Next.js App Router requires careful configuration for authentication
- Development bypass simplifies testing without active backend
- React Native provides a good foundation for mobile app development
- Dynamic CORS configuration with regex is more maintainable
- Consistent patterns between features simplifies development and maintenance
- Placeholder content during development improves testing experience
