## Completed Work

### Frontend Development
- ✅ Created Next.js application structure
- ✅ Implemented authentication context system
- ✅ Created login and registration pages
- ✅ Built dashboard UI with protected routes
- ✅ Added development authentication bypass
- ✅ Implemented API testing page
- ✅ Added custom 404 page with debug information
- ✅ Created framework identifier for Vercel
- ✅ Implemented API proxying configuration
- ✅ Fixed CORS issues between frontend and backend

### Backend Development
- ✅ Implemented Express/Node.js API structure
- ✅ Set up MongoDB connection
- ✅ Created user authentication endpoints
- ✅ Built JWT token generation and validation
- ✅ Added strategy and resource endpoints
- ✅ Implemented testing endpoints
- ✅ Deployed to Render.com

### Mobile App Development

- ✅ Added environment variables for production
- 🚧 Troubleshooting 404 issues

## In Progress
- 🚧 Addressing 404 errors on routes
- 🚧 Testing API connectivity
- 🚧 Finalizing deployment configuration
- 🚧 Implementing gRPC functionality

## Pending Tasks
- ⏳ Implement strategy execution UI
- ⏳ Connect frontend to operational backend
- ⏳ Add resource allocation functionality
- ⏳ Implement monitoring dashboard
- ⏳ Add analytics and tracking
- ⏳ Implement automatic experiment optimization
- ⏳ Build notification system
- ⏳ Complete mobile app functionality

## Recent Milestones
- 🏆 Successfully implemented authentication bypass system (April 30, 2025)
- 🏆 Deployed frontend to Vercel (April 29, 2025)
- 🏆 Built authentication system (April 29, 2025)
- 🏆 Created mobile app structure with React Native (May 5, 2025)

## Known Issues
1. Backend API connectivity issues
2. Type errors for Next.js modules (not affecting build)

## Next Priority
1. Test authentication flow with working API
2. Implement gRPC functionality
3. Connect mobile app to gRPC server
4. Implement dashboard functionality
5. Continue debugging backend API connectivity

## Learning & Insights
- Vercel has specific requirements for framework detection
- Next.js App Router requires careful configuration for authentication
- Development bypass simplifies testing without active backend
- React Native provides a good foundation for mobile app development
