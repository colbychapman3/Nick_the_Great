## Development Setup

The Nick the Great system operates with a minimalist technical footprint:

1. **Local Environment**
   - VS Code for documentation and file management
   - Web browser for platform access
   - Minimal local software requirements

2. **Cloud Services**
   - AI access via Claude interface
   - Platform accounts (managed by human)
   - Optional: Cloud storage for assets and backups

3. **Account Management**
   - Human-owned accounts on all platforms
   - Secure credential storage system
   - Clear authentication protocols

## Technical Constraints

The system operates within several technical constraints:

1. **AI Authentication Limitations**
   - AI cannot directly create or access accounts
   - Human must handle all platform logins
   - Authentication processes require human execution

2. **Financial Transaction Constraints**
   - AI cannot execute financial transactions
   - Payment processing requires human authorization
   - Financial accounts require human ownership and management

3. **Verification Requirements**
   - Identity verification requires human participation
   - CAPTCHA and security challenges require human intervention
   - Legal agreements require human review and acceptance

4. **Platform Policy Compliance**
   - Terms of service compliance across platforms
   - Content policies and restrictions
   - Automated systems limitations

5. **Data Access Limitations**
   - Limited real-time data without API access
   - Market data access requires human facilitation
   - Analytics depends on human-provided information

## Dependencies

The system has the following key dependencies:

1. **AI Capabilities**
   - Continuous AI availability
   - Content generation capabilities
   - Research and analysis functions
   - Strategic reasoning capabilities

2. **Human Collaboration**
   - Regular time availability (15-30 minutes daily)
   - Decision-making authority
   - Platform access and authentication
   - Financial transaction handling

3. **Platform Availability**
   - Digital service marketplace stability
   - Content platform policies and monetization
   - Payment processing systems
   - Account systems and verification methods

4. **Internet Infrastructure**
   - Reliable internet connectivity
   - Web browser access
   - File system access for documentation

## Tool Usage Patterns

The Nick the Great system employs specific tool usage patterns:

1. **Documentation-First Workflow**
   - Begin with detailed documentation of strategies
   - Create templates before implementation
   - Maintain comprehensive records of all experiments
   - Regular updates to memory bank components

2. **Platform Interaction Model**
   - AI prepares all content and strategies
   - Human handles platform interface and authentication
   - AI assists with responses and optimization
   - Human executes critical transactions

3. **Analytics Approach**
   - Standardized metrics across all experiments
   - Regular performance review cycles
   - Data-driven resource allocation
   - Continuous optimization based on performance

4. **Communication Protocol**
   - Structured format for decision requests
   - Clear documentation of all decisions
   - Regular status updates and performance reviews
   - Explicit task assignments and responsibilities

5. **Asset Management**
   - Reusable content and template library
   - Standardized file naming and organization
   - Version control for key assets
   - Cross-platform asset adaptation

This technology context document outlines the technical foundation for the Nick the Great project and should inform all implementation decisions related to tools, platforms, and technical approaches.
