# Implementation Plan: The Indoor Eden Co.

This plan details the step-by-step process for launching The Indoor Eden Co. using zero-capital resources. We'll leverage free platforms and tools to create a professional affiliate website while maintaining the brand identity and content strategy outlined in our previous documents.

## Platform Selection

After evaluating free website platforms, we'll use **WordPress.com (Free Plan)** for the following reasons:

- Better SEO capabilities than other free platforms
- More professional appearance with customizable themes
- Easier transition path to self-hosted WordPress later
- Built-in analytics and basic customization options
- Good mobile responsiveness
- Ability to add basic affiliate links

**Limitations to be aware of:**
- WordPress.com branding will be visible
- Limited theme customization on free plan
- No plugin installation on free plan
- Limited monetization options (but affiliate links are allowed)
