# Note on Managing VSCode Editors

I notice you have many open tabs in VSCode. To close unused editors, you have a few options:

## Option 1: Manual Closing
You can manually close individual tabs by clicking the "x" on each tab or right-clicking and selecting "Close".

## Option 2: Close All But Current
Right-click on the tab you want to keep and select "Close Others" to close all tabs except the current one.

## Option 3: Use VSCode Commands
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) to open the command palette
2. Type "Close All Editors" and select that command to close all open tabs
3. Or type "Close All But Active Editor" to keep only the current tab open

## Option 4: Switch to Code Mode
If you'd like me to close the editors programmatically:
1. Use the switch_mode tool to change to Code mode
2. I can then use the execute_command tool to close the editors

Let me know which approach you prefer, and I'll assist accordingly.
