# Experiment: AI-Driven Niche Ebooks

## Experiment ID: EXP003
**Start Date:** [Pending]  
**Status:** Planning  
**Current Phase:** Setup

## Business Hypothesis

**Core Hypothesis:** Creating and selling targeted niche ebooks can generate passive income with minimal ongoing time investment by leveraging AI for content creation and low-cost publishing platforms.

**Key Assumptions:**
1. We can identify profitable niche topics with high search interest but low competition
2. AI can generate high-quality, valuable ebook content that customers will pay for
3. Self-publishing platforms like Amazon KDP, Gumroad, and Leanpub can be used without upfront investment
4. Basic but professional ebook covers can be created using free tools like Canva
5. Cross-promotion with other Phase 0 experiments will enhance visibility and sales

**Success Prediction:** This experiment will be successful if it generates positive passive income (at least $50/month) within 2 months, with a Return on Time Invested (ROTI) of at least $15/hr.

**Setup Completion Criteria:** Accounts created, initial ebook topic selected with comprehensive outline approved, content creation process established, cover template created.

### Execution Phase

**Regular AI Tasks:**

2. Research specific sections requiring factual information (as needed)
3. Create promotional content for social media/Pinterest (weekly)
4. Analyze keywords and categories for platform optimization (per book)
5. Generate ideas for future ebook topics based on market trends (biweekly)

**Regular Human Tasks:**

5. Monitor sales and review metrics (weekly)

**Execution Timeline:**
- Week 1: Complete research and topic selection
- Week 2: Content creation and editing
- Week 3: Formatting, final review, and publication
- Week 4: Promotion and beginning of second ebook

## Metrics & Tracking

**Primary Success Metric:** Return on Time Invested (ROTI) - Revenue generated divided by total hours of human time invested

**Secondary Metrics:**
1. Number of ebooks sold per platform (daily/weekly/monthly)
2. Revenue per platform (daily/weekly/monthly)
3. Customer reviews and ratings (average score)
4. Email list growth from ebook buyers

**Lead Indicators:**
- Initial sales within first week of publication
- Social media/Pinterest engagement with promotional content
- Click-through rates from promotion to sales pages
- Browse-to-buy ratio on Amazon

**Tracking Method:** Central spreadsheet with daily updates on sales, revenue, time investment, and platform performance

**Review Schedule:**
- Daily: Quick check of sales, reviews, and basic metrics
- Weekly: Comprehensive review of all metrics and adjustment planning
- Monthly: In-depth analysis with comparison to other Phase 0 experiments

## Resource Allocation

**Initial Time Investment:**
- AI: 2-3 hours per day (largely automated)
- Human: 15-30 minutes per day + 3-4 hours for initial setup

**Expected Evolution:**
- Human time will decrease for subsequent ebooks as templates and processes are established
- Initial surge of time required during publication weeks
- More time shifted to marketing as catalog grows

**Maximum Resource Allocation:**
- Human time not to exceed 5 hours per week during steady state
- If time requirements consistently exceed 5 hours per week without corresponding revenue increase, reevaluate approach

## Decision Framework

**Continuation Criteria:**
- ROTI of at least $10/hr after first ebook
- Positive sales trend (week-over-week growth)
- At least 3-star average reviews

**Scaling Triggers:**
- ROTI exceeds $15/hr consistently
- Cross-promotion showing significant impact
- Specific niche showing exceptional performance

**Adjustment Triggers:**
- No sales within first 10 days of publication
- Average review rating below 3.5 stars
- ROTI below $8/hr after first month

**Termination Criteria:**
- ROTI below $5/hr after 2 months of effort
- Inability to produce quality content that satisfies customers (evidenced by reviews)
- Consistent downward trend in sales despite adjustments
