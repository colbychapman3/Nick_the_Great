# Autonomous Money Generation Framework (AMGF)

The Autonomous Money Generation Framework is a comprehensive system designed to maximize daily revenue through fully autonomous operations. It leverages AI-powered digital services, content arbitrage, and micro-arbitrage opportunities while implementing autonomous decision-making, workflow automation, and self-optimization capabilities.

## System Architecture

The AMGF is built using a containerized microservices architecture, with the following core components:

### Core Components

1. **Strategy Selection Engine**
   - Opportunity Scanner: Identifies high-potential opportunities across platforms
   - ROI Predictor: Analyzes opportunities and predicts expected returns
   - Resource Allocator: Optimally distributes resources across strategies

2. **Execution System**
   - Digital Service Executor: Delivers services on platforms like Fiverr and Upwork
   - Content Arbitrage System: Transforms and monetizes content across platforms
   - Micro-Arbitrage Engine: Exploits price discrepancies across digital marketplaces

3. **Monitoring & Optimization**
   - Performance Tracker: Monitors performance metrics in real-time
   - Real-time Optimizer: Makes continuous adjustments to maximize returns
   - Reinvestment Manager: Automatically reinvests profits for compound growth

4. **Integration Layer**
   - API Gateway: Provides a unified API for all system components
   - Platform Integrations: Connects to external platforms and services

5. **User Interface**
   - Dashboard: Web-based interface for monitoring and controlling the system

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js (for dashboard development)
- MongoDB (for data storage)
- Redis (for caching and pub/sub)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/amgf.git
   cd amgf
   ```

2. Configure environment variables:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Edit the `.env` file to set your API keys and configuration settings.

3. Build and start the containers:
   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. Access the dashboard:
   ```
   http://localhost:8081
   ```

### Initial Setup

1. Create a user account through the API Gateway:
   ```
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/auth/register -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username":"admin","password":"password"}'
   ```

2. Log in to the dashboard using the created account.

3. Generate an API key through the dashboard.

4. Configure platform connections in the settings page.

## Usage

### Running a Complete Cycle

1. From the dashboard, click the "Run System Cycle" button to execute a complete cycle:
   - Scan for opportunities
   - Predict ROI for opportunities
   - Allocate resources
   - Execute strategies
   - Monitor performance
   - Optimize and reinvest

2. View real-time performance metrics on the dashboard.

### Manual Operations

You can also trigger individual components through the API:

- Scan for opportunities:
  ```
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/opportunities/scan -H "X-API-Key: your_api_key"
  ```

- Allocate resources:
  ```
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/allocate -H "X-API-Key: your_api_key"
  ```

- Get system status:
  ```
  curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/system/status -H "X-API-Key: your_api_key"
  ```

## Configuration

### Strategy Weights

You can adjust the weight of each strategy category:

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/strategy/weights -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-API-Key: your_api_key" -d '{"service":0.4,"content":0.3,"marketplace":0.3}'
```

### Risk Tolerance

Adjust the system's risk tolerance (0-1, higher = more risk tolerant):

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/risk/tolerance -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-API-Key: your_api_key" -d '{"risk_tolerance":0.6}'
```

### Resource Limits

Set the maximum resource allocation:

```
MAX_RESOURCE_ALLOCATION=1000
```

### Reinvestment Ratio

Configure how much profit is reinvested vs. reserved:

```
REINVESTMENT_RATIO=0.9
RESERVE_RATIO=0.1
```

## Development

### Adding New Components

1. Create a new directory in the appropriate category:
   ```
   mkdir -p amgf/core/new_component
   ```

2. Create the necessary files:
   - Dockerfile
   - requirements.txt (Python) or package.json (Node.js)
   - app.py or app.js

3. Add the component to docker-compose.yml:
   ```yaml
   new-component:
     build: ./core/new_component
     container_name: amgf-new-component
     restart: unless-stopped
     depends_on:
       - mongodb
       - redis
     environment:
       - MONGODB_URI=mongodb://mongodb:27017/amgf
       - REDIS_URI=redis://redis:6379
     volumes:
       - ./core/new_component:/app
     networks:
       - amgf-network
   ```

4. Update the API Gateway to include routes for the new component.

### Dashboard Development

To develop the dashboard:

1. Navigate to the dashboard directory:
   ```
   cd amgf/specialized/dashboard
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## Monitoring

The system includes comprehensive monitoring:

- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for visualization
- ELK stack for log management

Access Grafana at http://localhost:3000 and Kibana at http://localhost:5601.
